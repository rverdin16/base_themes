  h6.question.text-bold How often should I get my lawn mowed?
  p.answer Simply put, as often as possible! The more often a lawn is mowed, the less thatch build-up it will have and the better it will look. For a professional presentation, weekly or fortnightly cuts in summer and 3-4 weekly in winter keeps your lawn in order. This all depends of course, on how much water and fertilizer it is receiving and where you live.
